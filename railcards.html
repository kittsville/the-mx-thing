<h1>Buying a Railcard</h1>
<h2>Why does this need a separate page</h2>

<p>I was contacted by <a href='https://twitter.com/puckipedia'>@puckipedia</a> regarding the 16-25 railcard website asking for gender. I took a look and found this rabbit hole goes a bit deeper than I expected, with different railcards having slightly different forms, despite looking like just rebrands of the same website. In all cases, gender and title cannot be modified on the website, and <strong>you must phone the railcard company to get title or gender changed</strong> (as I did a number of years ago for my 16-25 railcard). Note that digital railcards do not include title.</p>

<p>I emailed National Railcards on 15th February 2019 to request a justification for requiring a binary gender on three of their railcards (16-25, 26-30 and Senior). Following a few email delays and some discussion, as of 28th March 2019, I'm pleased to confirm that <strong>National Railcards no longer require gender for any of their railcard application forms</strong>! Thank you to the Data Protection Team at Rail Delivery Group for discussing it with me and making the change.</p>
  
<p><strong>Update 2nd September 2020:</strong> In these trying/unfortunate/fuwa fuwa/difficult (delete as appropriate) times, it pains me to have to put bad news on this site, but it turns out that Railcards do get a sex value off you if you apply with a passport. Your passport has a machine-readable code at the bottom that contains various information to be read quickly by a computer. There's a breakdown of this information on <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine-readable_passport' target='_blank'>Wikipedia</a> and it turns out that Railcards will store sex as part of this information and requires M or F to be there. However, the machine-readable passport standard (ICAO Document 9303) states that the character that represents sex can be "M", "F" OR "&lt;", with "&lt;" officially meaning "unspecified". When using a passport with "&lt;" as the sex to apply for a railcard, you get an error message as can be seen in <a href='https://twitter.com/TheEnbyperor/status/1301095775372546048' target='_blank'>this Tweet by Q</a>. This does make me wonder if driving licenses have the same issue. I will contact Rail Delivery Group to find out more.</p>
